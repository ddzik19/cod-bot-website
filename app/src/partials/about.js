            Commander-B was firstly developed for a group of friends that
            enjoyed playing Warzone together. Now our Discord bot is available
            for anyone! This Discord bot was a small portfolio project which
            turned out to be something that people were missing.

            Our Discord bot allows users to get their desired gun builds with a
            simple command, as to looking it up on the internet and looking for
            the right, up to date build. Now people can use a simple command
            that sends an image into the chat with their desired gun build.

            We get our gun builds from professional Call of Duty players. We
            found that they tend to stay up to date and create new builds
            according to patch notes.
